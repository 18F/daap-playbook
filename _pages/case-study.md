# Case Study: HHS Buyer’s Club

"The HHS Buyers Club is a HHS IDEA Lab sponsored project focused on addressing a critical problem in government: modernizing federal acquisition of information technology (IT) and related services. Given the expansion and impactful role of digital services throughout government, there are many opportunities to improve existing acquisition methods that are used to support government services, thereby directly benefiting the public.

## Purpose of HHS Buyers Club

Current government acquisition and procurement methods are no longer appropriate for modern software development practices. It has been widely recognized that government access to and use of technologies that support data and information management are lagging behind the private sector. According to the 2013 Chaos Manifesto from the Standish Group, out of all IT projects in excess of $10 million,  52% were found to be challenged and  48% failed.. Innovative strategies to leverage federal acquisitions processes are needed to seek better value and outcomes for the services we provide the public.

Current federal acquisitions approaches reflect unnecessary operational and cultural barriers to success (planning, evaluation, award, and implementation), including but not limited to the lack of true end user and stakeholder engagement from cradle to grave in a manner that maximizes value while minimizing spend. We’re not implementing new regulations or any new statutes but rather emphasizing new strategies allowed under the FAR or other approved legislation. Acquisition cycles are longer than IT development cycles, creating an unnecessary, lengthy, and outdated way of performing mission needs. Acquisitions require agility, both in terms of planning and implementation."
