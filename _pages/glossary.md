## Agile

* **Epic:**  A large or high level user story that can be broken down into a number of smaller stories. (NOTE:  https://confluence.atlassian.com/agile/jira-agile-user-s-guide/working-with-epics) 
* **Product Backlog:** a prioritized list of items for the development team to deliver. The most important items are shown at the top of the product backlog so the team knows what to deliver first. (NOTE:  https://www.atlassian.com/agile/backlogs) Items are often in the form of *user stories*.
* **Product Owner**: The member of a scrum team who is responsible for what the team produces and the order in which it’s produced. The Product Owner is charged with making sure that the team produces something that is of value to users and customers.
* **Retrospective:** At end of each sprint,  a retrospective is held which allows the team to reflect and adjust practices. Any team member can voice a problem or propose a solution.
* **Scrum Master**: The servant leader of the team who facilitates, removes impediments, and generaly ensures that the team is working well without managing them directly.
* **Sprint:** A short period of time (usually two weeks) during which the team produces some items of customer value.  Valuable feedback is sought from users and customers at the end of each sprint.
* **Sprint planning:** The team’s process of understanding and committing to a set of value to produce during the upcoming sprint. .
* **Standups:** the team meets daily for short meetings which are typically held standing up, face-to-face to encourage brief sessions. This is not a status meeting, it is a meeting for team self-organization around the work of the day.  Team members  plan for the most efficient and productive day for the team. Long answers and discussions should have follow-up in smaller groups after the standup meeting.


## Human-Centered Design

* **Design Thinking.** A human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer's toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.
* **Frameworks.** Visual representations of a system used to highlight key relationships and develop strategy.
* **Prototype.** Quickly created, representations of a product, program, or service to test a hypothesis or assumption about the usability and/or functionality of a feature or set of features.


## Lean Startup

* **Actionable Metrics:** Metrics used to help determine outcomes of experiments and better understand product performance. These metrics tie "[specific and repeatable actions to observed results.](https://leanstack.com/3-rules-to-actionable-metrics/)"
* **Innovation Accounting:** An accounting method to figure out if a startup is making a progress before there is enough gross numbers for traditional accounting to kick in. It is a way to define, measure, and communicate outcomes to stakeholders.
* **Minimum Viable Product:** As [Ash Maurya](https://leanstack.com/minimum-viable-product/) states, a Minimum Viable Product is the smallest thing you can build that delivers a customer value (and as a bonus captures some of that value back).
* **Pivot:** A structured course correction taken by an organization designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, strategy, and engine of growth.
* **Validated Learning:** Determining pivot or preservere decision using actionable metrics from experiments. 


## Modular Contracting

* **Increments.** Useful sub-segments of a larger contract that are used to develop and implement discrete products and capabilities related to a larger system.
* **Modular architecture.** A system consisting of discrete but connect components (or modules) that can be replaced, reused, or added to without affecting the rest of the system.


## Open Innovation

* **Challenges and Prize Competitions.** With a challenge and prize competition, a "seeker" poses a problem or question to the public and “solvers” respond and submit solutions. An agency pays only for those solutions that meet the criteria and are chosen as winners. (NOTE:  https://www.challenge.gov/about/) Success in these competitions depend on the skill, judgement, and knowledge of the participants and does not wholly rely on chance.
* **Citizen Science**. When the public participates voluntarily in the scientific process with the federal government and nongovernmental organizations, addressing real-world problems in ways that may include formulating research questions, conducting scientific experiments, collecting and analyzing data, interpreting results, making new discoveries, developing technologies and applications, and solving complex problems. (NOTE:  https://www.citizenscience.gov/about/)
* **Crowdsourcing.** When organizations submit an open call for voluntary assistance from a large group of individuals for online, distributed problem solving. (NOTE:  https://www.citizenscience.gov/about/)
* **Hackathons.** An event of any length of time where people, usually from varying disciplines, come together to solve problems to a specific topic.
* **Open Source.** Denotes software whose source code is made freely available and can be modified and redistributed. The full defintion for open source can be found here https://opensource.org/osd-annotated.
