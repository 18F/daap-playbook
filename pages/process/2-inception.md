# Inception

Inception, a term adapted from agile development, is a short, days long discovery spike used to define the key inputs needed to create a more informed solicitation for your digital acquisition. The goal of inception is to quickly align your digital acquisitions team around a shared understanding of who the end users are, the problem you are trying to solve, and a vision for how the product will best serve end users and your organization over time. Inception allows your team to create improved solicitations based on prioritized, actionable user stories and focused product objectives. The entire cross-functional team and key stakeholders should be involved for the entirety of the inception phase and this should occur before your contracting officers begin to develop the solicitation.

Key activities include, but are not limited to:

* Creating proto-personas
* Deconstructing the problem
* Drafting a problem statement
* Capturing assumptions and hypotheses
* Identifying the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
* Defining a product vision
* Determining a product strategy
* User story mapping

## Creating proto-personas

### Overview

In order to identify your key users and to ensure alignment among the team during inception, create proto-personas. Proto-personas are:

* A variation of personas used develop early design hypotheses
* An encapsulation of the organization’s beliefs about who is using your product or service and what is motivating them to do so
* Used to initiate and reinforce awareness of the end user’s point of view during strategic planning

It is also important to note that although proto-personas are a valuable tool, they are not:

* A substitute for heavily researched personas based on feedback from actual users of the product
* Validated representations of the organization’s target audience

If your team or program have already created actual personas (ones based on end user research) for the product, those can be used in place of creating proto-personas for inception.

### How-to Guide

Steps for creating proto-personas:

1. Individually, each team member should spend a few minutes listing out all of the different types of users for the product which come to mind. Everyone should focus on listing end users, people who will actually use the product when it is built.
2. In small groups of 2, each pairing should discuss the users they have identified and list key information about each such as demographics, needs and goals, and behaviors. Each type of user should also have a name and a quick sketch associated with it.
3. Bring the full team back together to discuss each user type the pairings have created. After each have been discussed, narrow the list down to no more than five to focus on for this product. This can be done using dot voting or any other prioritization technique.
4. Once you have prioritized the proto-personas you plan to focus on as a team, determine which attributes would be most important to consider across all user types.
5. For each attribute you choose, rank each of the prioritized proto-personas against that attribute.
6. Document your team’s final output for each of the prioritized proto-personas digitally so that will be easier to share and reuse in future conversations. The final proto-personas should include a name, sketch, key demographic information, needs and goals of that person in relation the product, and list of their behaviors.

## Deconstructing the Problem

### Overview

When developing new products, processes, programs, most agencies are not sufficiently rigorous in defining the problems they are attempting to solve and articulating why those issues are important across the organization and to vendors. Agencies often miss opportunities, waste resources, and end up pursuing innovation initiatives that aren’t properly aligned with their core mission because they have not properly understood the problem.

Problem deconstruction helps focus your team at the beginning of a new project and ensures that you are solving the right problem and tackling it in the right way with your acquisition strategy. In the end, your team should be able to answer the following questions:

- What is the solvable problem?  
- Who has the problem or who is the customer?  
- What form should the final solution take? What is the scope (in time, money, resources, technologies) that can be used to solve the problem?  
- What barriers and constraints exist to solving this problem? 
  

### How-to Guide

Creating a Problem Statement

1. Understand your team’s current understanding of the problem by answering the “Campfire Questions”: 
    1. What problem are we solving for our users? 
    2. Why is solving it important? 
    3. Why now? 
2. As a group, draft a problem statement based on the assumptions and current understanding of the problem from your team. 
3. Use the [CATWOE Analysis](http://bpmgeek.com/blog/what-catwoe-analysis) to identify the people, processes, and environment that contributes to the problem. 
4. If stuck, use the [Five Ws (Who, What, When, Where Why) and H](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws) to answer fundamental questions about your products. 
5. Identify barriers and constraints that may have prohibited to this problem from being solved previously. Barriers are obstructions that can be overcome (like a fence) while constraints are limiting factors that can’t be overcome. 
6. Reframe the problem statement to answer these questions: 
    1. **What is the solvable problem?** This should explain why the team is needed. 
    2. **Who has the problem or who is the customer?** This should explain who needs the solution and who will decide the problem has been solved. 
    3. **What form should the final solution take?** What is the scope (in time, money, resources, technologies) that can be used to solve the problem?  
    4. **What barriers and constraints exist to solving this problem?**
