# Modular Contracting

As described in the [FAR](https://www.acquisition.gov/sites/default/files/current/far/html/Subpart%2039_1.html#wp1096828), modular contracting is,
> intended to reduce program risk and to incentivize contractor performance while meeting the Government’s need for timely access to rapidly changing technology. 

> When using modular contracting, an acquisition of a system of information technology may be divided into several smaller acquisition increments that—

> 1. Are easier to manage individually than would be possible in one comprehensive acquisition;

> 2. Address complex information technology objectives incrementally in order to enhance the likelihood of achieving workable systems or solutions for attainment of those objectives;

> 3. Provide for delivery, implementation, and testing of workable systems or solutions in discrete increments, each of which comprises a system or solution that is not dependent on any subsequent increment in order to perform its principal functions;

> 4. Provide an opportunity for subsequent increments to take advantage of any evolution in technology or needs that occur during implementation and use of the earlier increments; and

> 5. Reduce risk of potential adverse consequences on the overall project by isolating and avoiding custom-designed components of the system.
