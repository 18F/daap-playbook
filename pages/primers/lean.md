# Lean 

## Definition

Lean methodology can be summed up as the process of creating more value for customers and reducing waste. Lean Startup is a methodology, coined by Eric Reis, to shorten their product development cycle by using hypothesis driven experimentation and continous improvment through iterative product releases and validated learning. The distinct characteristics of lean startup are experimentation (instead of elaborate planning), customer feedback (instead of intuition), and iterative design (instead of doing big design up front).

## History

When you hear Lean [insert noun] you can thank our friends over at Toyota. Taiichi Ohno started working as an engineer at Toyota motor company in 1943 and is considered the father of the Toyota Production System (TPS), also known as just-in-time production. His system was devised to eliminate the eight common [forms of waste](https://www.isixsigma.com/dictionary/8-wastes-of-lean/).

This philosophy has been applied to other industries such as Lean Thinking, Lean UX, Lean Startup, Lean Product Design, etc. These are all just lean principles applied to different contexts. The Lean processes are to help you when you are starting something new. It’s possible to use it to refine existing products or services, but it is best used when defining or refining the model for a new product, service, or program.


[According to entreprenur Steve Blank](https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything), the fallacy of developing a "perfect business plan" includes the following: 

1. Business plans rarely survive first contact with customers. As the boxer Mike Tyson once said about his opponents’ prefight strategies: “Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”
2. No one besides venture capitalists and the late Soviet Union requires five-year plans to forecast complete unknowns. These plans are generally fiction, and dreaming them up is almost always a waste of time.
3. Start-ups are not smaller versions of large companies. They do not unfold in accordance with master plans. The ones that ultimately succeed go quickly from failure to failure, all the while adapting, iterating on, and improving their initial ideas as they continually learn from customers.


## Common Questions About Lean Startup

**Q: How do I decide between using Agile, Lean, and Lean Startup methods?**

A: [Salim Virani](http://www.salimvirani.com/the-history-of-leanstartup-and-how-to-make-sense-of-it-all/) explains it best as, "Agile usually fits better into existing businesses as a way to improve product development when the customer and the need is known. Lean usually makes more sense when a process needs to be improved and managed for effectiveness. Lean Startup usually makes the most sense when the customer, the product, or the ways to grow the business are not well-established."
