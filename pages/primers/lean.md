# Lean 

## Definition

Lean methodology can be summed up as the process of creating more value for customers and reducing waste. Lean Startup is a methodology, coined by Eric Reis, to shorten their product development cycle by using hypothesis driven experimentation and continous improvment through iterative product releases and validated learning. The distinct characteristics of lean startup are experimentation (instead of elaborate planning), customer feedback (instead of intuition), and iterative design (instead of doing big design up front).

## History

When you hear Lean [insert noun] you can thank our friends over at Toyota. Taiichi Ohno started working as an engineer at Toyota motor company in 1943 and is considered the father of the Toyota Production System (TPS), also known as just-in-time production. His system was devised to eliminate the eight common [forms of waste](https://www.isixsigma.com/dictionary/8-wastes-of-lean/).

This philosophy has been applied to other industries such as Lean Thinking, Lean UX, Lean Startup, Lean Product Design, etc. These are all just lean principles applied to different contexts. The Lean processes are to help you when you are refining a process or find solutions when the product, customer, or business models are not well defined.

Lean Startup was coined by Eric Ries which is a principled approach to new product development. His work was influenced by Steve Blank's [The Four Steps to Epiphany](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0976470705?tag=lessolearn01-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=0976470705&adid=0E34NG800FT9HMWYP4D6&) and it is built upon 5 core principles:

1. Entreprenueurs are everwhere - and you may be one of them.
2. Entrepreneurship is management - 
3. Validated learning - results from running experiments that can test elements of a product vision.
4. Innovation accounting - method of measuring progress, setting up milestones, and prioritizing work when developing 
5. Build-measure-learn - the process of turning ideas into products bsed on customer feedback.


## Common Questions About Lean Startup

**Q: How do I decide between using Agile, Lean, and Lean Startup methods?**

A: [Salim Virani](http://www.salimvirani.com/the-history-of-leanstartup-and-how-to-make-sense-of-it-all/) explains it best as, "Agile usually fits better into existing businesses as a way to improve product development when the customer and the need is known. Lean usually makes more sense when a process needs to be improved and managed for effectiveness. Lean Startup usually makes the most sense when the customer, the product, or the ways to grow the business are not well-established."
