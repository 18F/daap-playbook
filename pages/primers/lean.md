# Lean

## Definition

Lean methodology can be summed up as the process of creating more value for customers and reducing waste. Lean prescribes personal and organizational improvement along with waste removal as the way to continually grow a company. The distinct characteristics of lean are experimentation (instead of elaborate planning), customer feedback (instead of intuition), and iterative design (instead of doing big design up front).

[According to entreprenur Steve Blank](https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything), the fallacy of developing a "perfect business plan" includes the following: 

1. Business plans rarely survive first contact with customers. As the boxer Mike Tyson once said about his opponents’ prefight strategies: “Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”
2. No one besides venture capitalists and the late Soviet Union requires five-year plans to forecast complete unknowns. These plans are generally fiction, and dreaming them up is almost always a waste of time.
3. Start-ups are not smaller versions of large companies. They do not unfold in accordance with master plans. The ones that ultimately succeed go quickly from failure to failure, all the while adapting, iterating on, and improving their initial ideas as they continually learn from customers.


Waste is defined as:

1. Mura - waste due to variation
2. Muri - waste due to overburdening or stressing the people, equipment or system
3. Muda - "seven forms of waste" known as transportation, inventory, movement, waiting, overproduction, overprocessing, and defects. Sometimes the “disengagement of people” is identified as a form of Muda.

## Key Terms

* **Kaizen:** Japanese term for "change for the better", this is the Lean method for identifying root causes of waste in processes. Kaizen manifest in Agile as the Team Retrospective.
* **Fishbone (or Ishikawa) diagram. **A cause and effect diagram used to identify the root cause for an effect or problem.
* **Muri.** The Japanese word for overburden.
* **Mura.** The Japanese word for inconsistency or variation.
* **Muda.** The Japanese word for waste.

## History

When you hear Lean [insert noun] you can thank our friends over at Toyota. Taiichi Ohno started working as an engineer at Toyota motor company in 1943 and is considered the father of the Toyota Production System (TPS), also known as just-in-time production. His system was devised to eliminate the seven eight common forms of waste. These are:

1. **Transportation.** Moving things around.
2. **Inventory.** Number of things.
3. **Motion.** Things moving around.
4. **Waiting.** Waiting to move things.
5. **Over-processing.** Doing too much work on things.
6. **Overproduction.** Making too many things.
7. **Defects.** Things with a boo boo.
8. **Waste of Unused Human Talent.** People not doing things.

This philosophy has been applied to other industries such as Lean Thinking, Lean UX, Lean Startup, Lean Product Design, etc. These are all just lean principles applied to different contexts. The Lean processes are to help you when you are starting something new. It’s possible to use it to refine existing products or services, but it is best used when defining or refining the model for a new product, service, or program.

## Common Questions About Lean

**Q: What’s the difference between Agile and Lean?**

A: Lean manufacturing is the public version of the Toyota Production System, developed in the years following WWII in Japan with important contributions from American pioneer W. Edwards Deming. Lean is a method of organizational and process improvement aimed at removing waste from the process of building value for customers. Lean rests on the twin pillars of Respect for People and Continuous Learning. Agile has its conceptual roots in Lean but focuses most specifically on software development and provides a framework for a different cultural approach.
