          <p>As an agency is paramount that you build the right digital acquisitions team and provide them with the right training. Your teams should be cross-functional and have a fundamental understanding of agile, lean, human-centered design, and open innovation. It is important to think of this learning as foundational and continuous. Technology changes fast and your team will have to learn to keep pace with it to maintain the market expertise necessary to make smart at digital acquisition decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Key activities include:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Identifying Key Roles</li>
  <li>Training</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of this phase you should have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A cross functional team to work on the digital acquisition</li>
  <li>Identified gaps in skills on the team and a plan to address them</li>
  <li>Provided training and resources to get the team up to speed on the fundamentals of digital</li>
</ul>

<p>We have created introductory primers on agile, lean, human-centred design, and open innovation to help you and your team become more familiar with those concepts. We have also identified roles and skills that would be helpful to have on your cross-functional teams.</p>

<h2 id="why-build-cross-functional-teams">Why Build Cross-Functional Teams?</h2>

<p>Avengers assemble! All acquisitions are hard work but with the right team gathered, it becomes so much easier. Using cross-functional teams will help. A cross-functional team is one which has all of the skills necessary to deliver a small unit of completed value. Cross-functional teams will help your agency make decisions quicker, deliver work sooner and with fewer defects, improve communication flow on projects, and promote knowledge sharing. This has worked across agencies like HHS, USDS, and 18F to improve their digital acquisition capacity.</p>

<p>Some of the key roles for a digital acquisitions team are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Acquisition Innovation Advocate (AIA)</li>
  <li><a href="#heading=h.o2kmqkdp0uzv">Architecture / Engineering</a></li>
  <li><a href="#heading=h.h504fxlr64wd">User Research and Experience Design</a></li>
  <li><a href="#heading=h.6hhhf8827qsz">Product Strategy</a></li>
  <li><a href="#heading=h.4oi987je8x2b">Acquisition / Procurement</a></li>
  <li><a href="#heading=h.yivcs93krlld">Data Management</a></li>
  <li><a href="#heading=h.5xechdd5rt0r">Cybersecurity / Operations</a></li>
  <li><a href="#heading=h.b9a5rmugqsnx">Policy and Law</a></li>
  <li><a href="#heading=h.yuf7km625kua">Agile Project Management</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the super powers needed to ensure the best chance of success are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have experience or willingness to participate fully in collaborative cross-functional teams</li>
  <li>Enjoy decision-making</li>
  <li>Have experience in collaborative problem-solving and thinking in teams</li>
  <li>Be familiar with, or curious about, lean and agile methods</li>
  <li>Be willing to engage and learn</li>
  <li>Be comfortable with periods of ambiguity</li>
  <li>Enjoy delivering on timelines</li>
  <li>Willing to teach, coach, and learn from teammates and peers</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also look for these types of skills in each role when assembling your cross-functional team.</p>

<p><strong>A special note about cross-functional teams:</strong> *individuals can serve in multiple roles depending on their skillset. Your core team should have many of these skills but feel free to pull in extra help from around your agency when necessary to further support your team. Use this as a guide to choosing team members for the digital acquisitions pilots. *</p>

<p>Once you have decided on a team you will need to determine which areas they could use extra training on.</p>

<h2 id="team-collaboration">Team Collaboration</h2>

<p>For this process to work, it is going to be important that you move together as a team to move the pilot forward. Here are some ground rules that we have found help with team work:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Keep the project first</strong>. Push your personal ego and pride to the side and always make decisions based on what would be best for the project.</li>
  <li><strong>Be open and transparent.</strong> Each team member should understand the process and how decisions are made within the team. Keeping everyone informed and providing mechanisms to integrate new ideas will help improve team dynamics.</li>
  <li><strong>Overcommunicate.</strong> First, the team should agree on the best way to facilitate communication and second, the team should follow it. The aim here is clarity and by over communicating, the team will be able to push the project forward whether they are in the room together or working asynchronously.</li>
  <li><strong>Meet with a purpose.</strong> Time is always of the essence so be sure to have a clear agenda and desired outcomes for meetings.</li>
  <li><strong>Create a safe space for ideas.</strong> Do not be afraid as a team to try something new and be willing to listen to new approaches to solve the problems in front of you.</li>
  <li><strong>Appreciate candor.</strong> Allowing space for team members to speak directly about what is working and what is not working will help speed up the workflow.</li>
  <li>**Value other disciplines. **Each team member will bring something valuable to the team based on their experience and expertise.</li>
